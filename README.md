# CSCI-5448-Project-1.2
Code submission for CSCI 5448 Project 1.2 in Fall 2022.

Lincoln Rychecky - lincoln.rychecky@colorado.edu
Java Version: openjdk version "17" 2021-09-14

All .java files and .txt output files are located in the src folder. There is 1 Main file that runs both projects.

Assumptions made:
#1) For the variance/std calculation, I assumed that I should calculate for the population rather than a sample.
#2) I was not sure what was meant by the "Print" method in the instructions for program 2 so I just included a line to print the output
of the palindrome method.

For the Sort method of problem 2 I referenced this page for a strategy: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-a-string-in-java-2-different-ways/
